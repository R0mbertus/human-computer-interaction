Repo for Human Computer Interaction code @ VU

## Install and usage
To get started, first do `npm install` to setup the project for the first time
and then do `npm run build` to compile the `postcss/styles.css` file to 
`src/styles.css` or alternatively use `npm run watch` to have the `postcss/styles.css`
autocompile when it changes.  
Use the Live Server extension to test it locally
